The first competitive games started on arcade machines in the late 1970s with Space Invader and Twin Galaxies where the professional players strive to beat each other's record to become the world record holder. In the 1980s, more games were released that many of us know today like Pac-Man. A shift from arcades to gaming consoles occurred with the release of Nintendo systems. The new popularized way of gaming was becoming more accessible to the average consumer than ever before. As Nintendo continued to grow through the 1990s, the fast advancing computer technology became a new and different mode of gaming with personal computers.
